Sharing
=======

Once you have a volume, create at least one share so that the storage is accessible by the other computers in your network. The type of share you create
depends upon the operating system(s) running in your network, your security requirements, and expectations for network transfer speeds.

Beginning with version 9.3, FreeNAS速 provides an :ref:`Initial Configuration Wizard` for creating shares. The Wizard will automatically create the correct
type of dataset and permissions for the type of share, set the default permissions for the share type, and start the service needed by the share. It is
recommended to use the Wizard to create shares, fine-tune the share settings using the instructions in the rest of this chapter if needed, then to fine-tune
the default permissions from the client operating system to meet the requirements of the network.

.. note:: shares are created to provide and control access to an area of storage. Before creating your shares, it is recommended to make a list of the users
   that will need access to storage data, which operating systems these users are using, whether or not all users should have the same permissions to the
   stored data, and whether or not these users should authenticate before accessing the data. This information can help you determine which type of share(s)
   you need to create, whether or not you need to create multiple datasets in order to divide up the storage into areas with differing access and permission
   requirements, and how complex it will be to setup your permission requirements. It should be noted that a share is used to provide access to data. If you
   delete a share, it removes access to data but does not delete the data itself.

The following types of shares and services are available:

* :ref:`Apple (AFP) Shares`: the Apple File Protocol (AFP) type of share is a good choice if all of your computers run Mac OS X.

* :ref:`Unix (NFS) Shares`: the Network File System (NFS) type of share is accessible by Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, and the professional and enterprise versions
  (not the home editions) of Windows. It is a good choice if there are many different operating systems in your network. Depending upon the operating system,
  it may require the installation or configuration of client software on the desktop.
  
* :ref:`WebDAV Shares`: this type of share is accessible using an authenticated web browser (read-only) or
  `WebDAV client <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV#Clients>`_ running on any operating system.

* :ref:`Windows (CIFS) Shares`: the Common Internet File System (CIFS) type of share is accessible by Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and BSD computers, but it is
  slower than an NFS share due to the single-threaded design of Samba. It provides more configuration options than NFS and is a good choice on a network
  containing any Windows systems. However, it is a poor choice if the CPU on the FreeNAS速 system is limited; if your CPU is maxed out, you need to upgrade
  the CPU or consider another type of share.

* :ref:`Block (iSCSI)` shares: this type of share appears as an unformatted disk to clients running iSCSI initiator software or a virtualization solution such
  as VMware.

If you are looking for a solution that allows fast access from any operating system, consider configuring the :ref:`FTP` service instead of a share and use a
cross-platform FTP and file manager client application such as `Filezilla <https://filezilla-project.org/>`_. Secure FTP can be configured if the data needs to be encrypted.

If data security is a concern and your network's users are familiar with SSH command line utilities or
`WinSCP <http://winscp.net/eng/index.php>`_, consider configuring the :ref:`SSH` service instead of a share. It will be slower than unencrypted FTP due to the overhead of
encryption, but the data passing through the network will be encrypted.

.. note:: while the GUI will let you do it, it is a bad idea to share the same volume or dataset using multiple types of access methods. Different types of
   shares and services use different file locking methods. For example, if the same volume is configured to use both NFS and FTP, NFS will lock a file for
   editing by an NFS user, but a FTP user can simultaneously edit or delete that file. This will result in lost edits and confused users. Another example: if
   a volume is configured for both AFP and CIFS, Windows users may be confused by the extra filenames used by Mac files and delete the ones they don't
   understand; this will corrupt the files on the AFP share. Pick the one type of share or service that makes the most sense for the types of clients that
   will access that volume, and configure that volume for that one type of share or service. If you need to support multiple types of shares, divide the
   volume into datasets and use one dataset per share.

This section will demonstrate how to fine-tune the configuration of AFP, NFS, CIFS, WebDAV, and iSCSI shares. FTP and SSH configurations are described in
:ref:`Services Configuration`.

Apple (AFP) Shares
------------------

FreeNAS速 uses the
`Netatalk <http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/>`_
AFP server to share data with Apple systems. This section describes the configuration screen for fine-tuning AFP shares created using the
:ref:`Initial Configuration Wizard`. It then provides configuration examples for using the Wizard to create a guest share, configuring Time Machine to backup
to a dataset on the FreeNAS速 system, and for connecting to the share from a Mac OS X client.

To view the AFP share created by the Wizard, click :menuselection:`Sharing --> Apple (AFP)` and highlight the name of the share. Click its "Edit" button to see
the configuration options shown in Figure 10.1a. The values showing for these options will vary, depending upon the information given when the share was
created.

**Figure 10.1a: Creating an AFP Share**

.. image:: images/afp2.png

.. note:: while Table 10.1a summarizes the available options for fine-tuning an AFP share, you typically should not change the default settings of an AFP
          share as doing so may cause the share to not work as expected. Most settings are only available when you click "Advanced Mode". Do **not** change an
          advanced option unless you fully understand the function of that option. Refer to
          `Setting up Netatalk <http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/2.2/htmldocs/configuration.html>`_ for a more detailed explanation of the available options.

.. _Creating AFP Guest Shares:

Creating AFP Guest Shares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AFP supports guest logins, meaning that all of your Mac OS X users can access the AFP share without requiring their user accounts to first be created on or
imported into the FreeNAS速 system.

.. note:: if you create a guest share as well a share that requires authentication, AFP will only map users who login as guest to the guest share. This means
   that if a user logs in to the share that requires authentication, the permissions on the guest share may prevent that user from writing to the guest share.
   The only way to allow both guest and authenticated users to write to a guest share is to set the permissions on the guest share to 777 or to add the
   authenticated users to a guest group and set the permissions to 77x.

Before creating a guest share, go to :menuselection:`Services --> AFP` and make sure that the "Guest Access" box is checked.

Then, to create the AFP guest share, click "Wizard", then click the "Next" button twice to display the screen shown in Figure 10.1b. Complete the following
fields in this screen:

#. **Share name:** input a name for the share that is useful to you but which is under 27 characters and does not contain a period. In this example, the share
   is named *afp_guest*.

#. Click the button for "Mac OS X (AFP)".

#. Click the "Ownership" button. Click the drop-down "User" menu and select "nobody". Click the "Return" button to return to the previous screen.

#. Click the "Add" button. **If you forget to do this, the share will not be created**. Clicking the "Add" button will add an entry to the "Name" frame with
   the name that you typed into "Share name".

**Figure 10.1b: Creating a Guest AFP Share**

.. image:: images/afp6.png

Click the "Next" button twice, then the "Confirm" button to create the share. The Wizard will automatically create a dataset for the share that contains the
correct default permissions and start the AFP service for you, so that the share is immediately available. The new share will also be added as an entry to
:menuselection:`Sharing --> Apple (AFP)`.

Mac OS X users can connect to the guest AFP share by clicking :menuselection:`Go --> Connect to Server`. In the example shown in Figure 10.1c, the user has
input *afp://* followed by the IP address of the FreeNAS速 system.

Click the "Connect" button. Once connected, Finder will automatically open. The name of the AFP share will be displayed in the SHARED section in the left
frame and the contents of any data that has been saved in the share will be displayed in the right frame.

**Figure 10.1c: Connect to Server Dialogue**

.. image:: images/afp3.png

To disconnect from the volume, click the "eject" button in the "Shared" sidebar.

.. _Creating Authenticated and Time Machine Shares:

Creating Authenticated and Time Machine Shares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mac OS X includes the Time Machine application which can be used to schedule automatic backups.  In this configuration example, a Time Machine user will be
configured to backup to an AFP share on a FreeNAS速 system. It is recommended to create a separate Time Machine share for each user that will be using Time
Machine to backup their Mac OS X system to FreeNAS速. The process for creating an authenticated share for a user is the same as creating a Time Machine share
for that user.

To use the Wizard to create an authenticated or Time Machine share, enter the following information, as seen in the example in Figure 10.1d.

#. **Share name:** input a name for the share that is useful to you but which is under 27 characters and does not contain a period. In this example, the share
   is named *backup_user1*.

#. Click the button for "Mac OS X (AFP)" and check the box for "Time Machine". If the user will not be using Time Machine, leave the box unchecked.

#. Click the "Ownership" button. If the user already exists on the FreeNAS速 system, click the drop-down "User" menu to select their user account.  If the user
   does not yet exist on the FreeNAS速 system, type their name into the "User" field and check the "Create User" checkbox. If you want the user to be a member
   of a group that already exists on the FreeNAS速 system, click the drop-down "Group" menu to select the group name. If you wish to create a new group to be
   used by Time Machine users, input the name into the "Group" field and check the "Create Group" checkbox. Otherwise, input the same name as the user. In the
   example shown in Figure 10.1e, a new user named *user1* will be created, as well as a new group named
   *tm_backups*. Since a new user is being created, this screen prompts for the password for the user to use when accessing the share. It also provides an
   opportunity to change the default permissions on the share. When finished, click "Return" to return to the screen shown in Figure 10.1d.

#. Click the "Add" button. **If you forget to do this, the share will not be created**. Clicking the "Add" button will add an entry to the "Name" frame with
   the name that you typed into "Share name".

If you wish to configure multiple authenticated or Time Machine shares, repeat for each user, giving each user their own "Share name" and "Ownership". When
finished, click the "Next" button twice, then the "Confirm" button to create the share(s). The Wizard will automatically create a dataset for each share that
contains the correct ownership and start the AFP service for you, so that the share(s) are immediately available. The new share(s) will also be added as
entries to :menuselection:`Sharing --> Apple (AFP)`.

At this point, it may be desirable to configure a quota for each Time Machine share, to restrict backups from using all of the available space on the
FreeNAS速 system. The first time Time Machine makes a backup, it will create a full backup after waiting two minutes. It will then create a one hour
incremental backup for the next 24 hours, and then one backup each day, each week and each month.
**Since the oldest backups are deleted when a Time Machine share becomes full, make sure that the quota size you set is sufficient to hold the desired number of backups.**
Note that a default installation of Mac OS X is ~21 GB in size.

To configure a quota, go to :menuselection:`Storage --> Volumes` and highlight the entry for the share. In the example shown in Figure 10.1f, the Time
Machine share name is *backup_user1*. Click the "Edit Options" button for the share, then "Advanced Mode". Input a value in the "Quota for this dataset"
field then click "Edit Dataset" to save the change. In this example, the Time Machine share is restricted to 200GB.

**Figure 10.1f: Setting a Quota**

.. image:: images/afp9.png

To configure Time Machine on the Mac OS X client, go to :menuselection:`System Preferences --> Time Machine` which will open the screen shown in Figure 10.1g.
Click "ON" and a pop-up menu should show the FreeNAS速 system as a backup option. In our example, it is listed as *backup_user1 on "freenas"*. Highlight the
entry representing the FreeNAS速 system and click the "Use Backup Disk" button. A connection bar will open and will prompt for the user account's password--in
this example, the password that was set for the *user1* account.

If you receive a "Time Machine could not complete the backup. The backup disk image could not be created (error 45)" error when backing up to the FreeNAS速
system, you will need to create a sparsebundle image using
`these instructions <http://forum1.netgear.com/showthread.php?t=49482>`_.

If you receive the message "Time Machine completed a verification of your backups. To improve reliability, Time Machine must create a new backup for you." and
you do not want to perform another complete backup or lose past backups, follow the instructions in this
`post <http://www.garth.org/archives/2011,08,27,169,fix-time-machine-sparsebundle-nas-based-backup-errors.html>`_. Note that this can occur after performing a
scrub as Time Machine may mistakenly believe that the sparsebundle backup is corrupt.

.. index:: NFS, Network File System
.. _Unix (NFS) Shares:

Unix (NFS) Shares
-----------------

FreeNAS速 supports sharing over the Network File System (NFS). Clients use the :command:`mount` command to mount the share. Once mounted, the NFS share
appears as just another directory on the client system. Some Linux distros require the installation of additional software in order to mount an NFS share. On
Windows systems, enable Services for NFS in the Ultimate or Enterprise editions or install an NFS client application.

.. note:: for performance reasons, iSCSI is preferred to NFS shares when FreeNAS is installed on ESXi. If you are considering creating NFS shares on ESXi,
   read through the performance analysis at
   `Running ZFS over NFS as a VMware Store <http://blog.laspina.ca/ubiquitous/running-zfs-over-nfs-as-a-vmware-store>`_.

To create an NFS share using the Wizard, click the "Next" button twice to display the screen shown in Figure 10.2a. Input a "Share name" that makes sense to
you, but which does not contain a space. Click the button for "Generic Unix (NFS)", then click "Add" so that the share's name appears in the "Name" frame.
When finished, click the "Next" button twice, then the "Confirm" button to create the share. Creating an NFS share using the wizard will automatically create
a new dataset for the share, start the services required by NFS, and add an entry for the share in :menuselection:`Sharing --> Unix (NFS) Shares`.
Depending upon your requirements, you may wish to fine-tune the NFS share to control which IP addresses are allowed to access the NFS share and to restrict
the permissions of the mounted share.

**Figure 10.2a: NFS Share Wizard**

.. image:: images/nfs6.png

To edit the NFS share, click :menuselection:`Sharing --> Unix (NFS)`, highlight the entry for the share, and click its "Edit" button. In the example shown in
Figure 10.2b, the configuration screen is open for the *nfs_share1* share.

+---------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When creating the NFS share, keep the following points in mind:


#.  The "Maproot" and "Mapall" options are exclusive, meaning you can only use one or the other--the GUI will not let you use both. The "Mapall" options
    supersede the "Maproot" options. If you only wish to restrict the *root* user's permissions, set the "Maproot" option. If you wish to restrict the
    permissions of all users, set the "Mapall" options.

#.  Each volume or dataset is considered to be its own filesystem and NFS is not able to cross filesystem boundaries.

#.  The network or host must be unique per share and per filesystem or directory.

#.  The "All directories" option can only be used once per share per filesystem.

To better understand these restrictions, consider the following scenario where there are:

* 2 networks named *10.0.0.0/8* and
  *20.0.0.0/8*

* a ZFS volume named :file:`volume1` with 2 datasets named :file:`dataset1` and :file:`dataset2`

* :file:`dataset1` has a directory named :file:`directory1`

Because of restriction #3, you will receive an error if you try to create one NFS share as follows:

* "Authorized networks" set to *10.0.0.0/8 20.0.0.0/8*

* "Path" set to :file:`/mnt/volume1/dataset1` and :file:`/mnt/volume1/dataset1/directory1`

Instead, you should select a "Path" of :file:`/mnt/volume1/dataset1` and check the "All directories" box.

However, you could restrict that directory to one of the networks by creating two shares as follows.

First NFS share:

* "Authorized networks" set to *10.0.0.0/8*

* "Path" set to :file:`/mnt/volume1/dataset1`

Second NFS share:

* "Authorized networks" set to *20.0.0.0/8*

* "Path" set to :file:`/mnt/volume1/dataset1/directory1`

Note that this requires the creation of two shares as it can not be accomplished in one share.

.. _Example Configuration:

Example Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the "Mapall" options show as *N/A*. This means that when a user connects to the NFS share, they connect with the permissions associated with their
user account. This is a security risk if a user is able to connect as *root* as they will have complete access to the share.

A better scenario is to do the following:

#.  Specify the built-in *nobody* account to be used for NFS access.

#.  In the "Change Permissions" screen of the volume/dataset that is being shared, change the owner and group to *nobody* and set the permissions according to
    your specifications.

#.  Select *nobody* in the "Mapall User" and "Mapall Group" drop-down menus for the share in :menuselection:`Sharing --> Unix (NFS) Shares`.

With this configuration, it does not matter which user account connects to the NFS share, as it will be mapped to the *nobody* user account and will only
have the permissions that you specified on the volume/dataset. For example, even if the *root* user is able to connect, it will not gain
*root* access to the share.

.. _Connecting to the Share:

Connecting to the Share
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following examples, an NFS share on a FreeNAS速 system with the IP address of *192.168.2.2* has been configured as follows:

#.  A ZFS volume named :file:`/mnt/data` has its permissions set to the *nobody* user account and the
    *nobody* group.

#.  A NFS share has been created with the following attributes:

    * "Path": :file:`/mnt/data`

    * "Authorized Network": *192.168.2.0/24*

    * "MapAll User" and "MapAll Group" are both set to *nobody*

    * the "All Directories" checkbox has been checked

.. _From BSD or Linux:

From BSD or Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make this share accessible on a BSD or a Linux system, run the following command as the superuser (or with :command:`sudo`) from the client system. Repeat
on each client that needs access to the NFS share::

 mount -t nfs 192.168.2.2:/mnt/data /mnt

The :command:`mount` command uses the following options:

* **-t nfs:** specifies the type of share.

* **192.168.2.2:** replace with the IP address of the FreeNAS速 system

* **/mnt/data:** replace with the name of the NFS share

* **/mnt:** a mount point on the client system. This must be an existing,
  **empty** directory. The data in the NFS share will be made available to the client in this directory.

The :command:`mount` command should return to the command prompt without any error messages, indicating that the share was successfully mounted.

.. note:: if this command fails on a Linux system, make sure that the `nfs-utils <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nfs/files/nfs-utils/>`_ package is
   installed.

Once mounted, this configuration allows users on the client system to copy files to and from :file:`/mnt` (the mount point) and all files will be owned by
*nobody:nobody*. Any changes to :file:`/mnt` will be saved to the FreeNAS速 system's :file:`/mnt/data` volume.

Should you wish to make any changes to the NFS share's settings or wish to make the share inaccessible, first unmount the share on the client as the
superuser::

 umount /mnt

.. _From Microsoft:

From Microsoft
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windows systems can connect to NFS shares using Services for NFS (refer to the documentation for your version of Windows for instructions on how to find,
activate, and use this service) or a third-party NFS client.

`Nekodrive <http://code.google.com/p/nekodrive/downloads/list>`_
provides an open source graphical NFS client. To use this client, you will need to install the following on the Windows system:

* `7zip <http://www.7-zip.org/>`_
  to extract the Nekodrive download files

* NFSClient and NFSLibrary from the Nekodrive download page; once downloaded, extract these files using 7zip

* `.NET Framework 4.0 <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851>`_

Once everything is installed, run the NFSClient executable to start the GUI client. In the example shown in Figure 10.2c, the user has connected to the
example :file:`/mnt/data` share of the FreeNAS速 system at
*192.168.2.2*.

.. note:: Nekodrive does not support Explorer drive mapping via NFS. If you need this functionality,
   `try this utility <http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/nfsv4/windows/readme.html>`_
   instead.

**Figure 10.2c: Using the Nekodrive NFSClient from Windows 7 Home Edition**

.. _From Mac OS X:

From Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To mount the NFS volume from a Mac OS X client, click on :menuselection:`Go --> Connect to Server`. In the "Server Address" field, input *nfs://* followed by
the IP address of the FreeNAS速 system and the name of the volume/dataset being shared by NFS. The example shown in Figure 10.2d continues with our example of
*192.168.2.2:/mnt/data*.

Once connected, Finder will automatically open. The IP address of the FreeNAS速 system will be displayed in the SHARED section in the left frame and the
contents of the share will be displayed in the right frame. In the example shown in Figure 10.2e, :file:`/mnt/data` has one folder named :file:`images`. The
user can now copy files to and from the share.

Some NFS clients do not support the NLM (Network Lock Manager) protocol used by NFS. You will know that this is the case if the client receives an error that
all or part of the file may be locked when a file transfer is attempted. To resolve this error, add the option **-o nolock** when running the
:command:`mount` command on the client in order to allow write access to the NFS share.

If you receive an error about a "time out giving up" when trying to mount the share from a Linux system, make sure that the portmapper service is running
on the Linux client and start it if it is not. If portmapper is running and you still receive timeouts, force it to use TCP by including **-o tcp** in your
:command:`mount` command.

If you receive an error "RPC: Program not registered", upgrade to the latest version of FreeNAS速 and restart the NFS service after the upgrade in order
to clear the NFS cache.

If your clients are receiving "reverse DNS" errors, add an entry for the IP address of the FreeNAS速 system in the "Host name database" field of
:menuselection:`Network --> Global Configuration`.

If the client receives timeout errors when trying to mount the share, add the IP address and hostname of the client to the "Host name data base" field of
:menuselection:`Network --> Global Configuration`.

Some older versions of NFS clients default to UDP instead of TCP and do not auto-negotiate for TCP. By default, FreeNAS速 uses TCP. To support UDP connections, go to
:menuselection:`Services --> NFS` and check the box "Serve UDP NFS clients".

WebDAV Shares
------------------

Beginning with FreeNAS速 9.3, WebDAV shares can be created so that authenticated users can browse the contents of the specified volume, dataset, or directory
from a web browser.

Configuring WebDAV shares is a two step process. First, create the WebDAV share(s) to specify which data can be accessed. Then, configure the WebDAV service
by specifying the port, authentication type, and authentication password. Once the configuration is complete, the share can be accessed using a URL in the
format::

 protocol://IP_address:port_number/share_name
 
where:

* **protocol:** is either
  *http* or
  *https*, depending upon the "Protocol" configured in :menuselection:`Services --> WebDAV`.
  
* **IP address:** is the IP address or hostname of the FreeNAS速 system. Take care when configuring a public IP address to ensure that the network's firewall
  only allows access to authorized systems.
  
* **port_number:** is configured in :menuselection:`Services --> WebDAV`. If the FreeNAS速 system is to be accessed using a public IP address, consider
  changing the default port number and ensure that the network's firewall only allows access to authorized systems.
  
* **share_name:** is configured in :menuselection:`Sharing --> WebDAV Shares`.

Inputting the URL into a web browser will bring up an authentication pop-up message. Input a username of *webdav* and the password configured in
:menuselection:`Services --> WebDAV`.

.. warning:: at this time, only the *webdav* user is supported. For this reason, it is important to set a good password for this account and to only give the password to
   users which should have access to the WebDAV share.

To create a WebDAV share, click :menuselection:`Sharing --> WebDAV Shares --> Add WebDAV Share` which will open the screen shown in Figure 10.3a.

Once you click "OK", a pop-up will ask if you would like to enable the service. Once the service starts, review the settings in
:menuselection:`Services --> WebDAV` as they are used to determine which URL is used to access the WebDAV share and whether or not authentication is required
to access the share. These settings are described in :ref:`WebDAV`.

Windows (CIFS) Shares
---------------------

FreeNAS速 uses `Samba <https://www.samba.org/>`_ to share volumes using Microsoft's CIFS protocol. CIFS is built into the Windows and Mac OS X operating systems
and most Linux and BSD systems pre-install the Samba client in order to provide support for CIFS. If your distro did not, install the Samba client using your
distro's software repository.

The CIFS protocol supports many different types of configuration scenarios, ranging from the very simple to quite complex. The complexity of your scenario
depends upon the types and versions of the client operating systems that will connect to the share, whether or not the network has a Windows server, and
whether or not Active Directory is running in the Windows network. Depending upon your authentication requirements, you may need to create or import users and groups.

This chapter starts by summarizing the available configuration options. It will then demonstrate some common configuration scenarios as well as offer some
troubleshooting tips. It is recommended to first read through this entire chapter before creating any CIFS shares so that you have a good idea of the best
configuration scenario to meet your network's needs.

Figure 10.4a shows the configuration screen that appears when you click :menuselection:`Sharing --> Windows (CIFS Shares) --> Add Windows (CIFS) Share`.

**Figure 10.4a: Adding a CIFS Share**

.. image:: images/cifs2.png

Table 10.4a summarizes the options when creating a CIFS share. Some settings are only available when you click the "Advanced Mode" button. For simple sharing
scenarios, you will not need any "Advanced Mode" options. For more complex sharing scenarios, only change an "Advanced Mode" option if you understand the
function of that option. `smb.conf(5) <http://www.sloop.net/smb.conf.html>`_ provides more details for each configurable option.

Note the following regarding some of the "Advanced Mode" settings:

* Hostname lookups add some time to accessing the CIFS share. If you only use IP addresses, uncheck the "Hostnames lookups" box in :menuselection:`Services --> CIFS`.

* Be careful about unchecking the "Browsable to Network Clients" box. When this box is checked (the default), other users will see the names of every share that exists
  using Windows Explorer, but they will receive a permissions denied error message if they try to access someone else's share. If this box is unchecked, even the owner
  of the share won't see it or be able to create a drive mapping for the share in Windows Explorer. However, they can still access the share from the command line.
  Unchecking this option provides limited security and is not a substitute for proper permissions and password control.

* If you wish some files on a shared volume to be hidden and inaccessible to users, put a *veto files=* line in the "Auxiliary Parameters" field. The syntax for
  the "veto files" option and some examples can be found `here <http://www.sloop.net/smb.conf.html>`_.
  
To configure support for OS/2 clients, add this line to "Auxiliary Parameters"::

 lanman auth = yes
 
To configure lanman authentication for pre-NT authentication, add these lines instead::

 client lanman auth = yes
  client plaintext auth = yes

Table 10.4b provides an overview of the available VFS modules. Be sure to research each module **before** adding or deleting it from the "Selected" column of
the "VFS Objects" field for the share. Some modules will need additional configuration after they are added. Refer to
`Stackable VFS modules <https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/VFS.html>`_ and the
`vfs_* man pages <https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages/>`_
for more details.

.. _Configuring Unauthenticated Access:

Configuring Unauthenticated Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CIFS supports guest logins, meaning that users can access the CIFS share without needing to provide a username or password. This type of share is convenient
as it is easy to configure, easy to access, and does not require any users to be configured on the FreeNAS速 system. This type of configuration is also the
least secure as anyone on the network can access the contents of the share. Additionally, since all access is as the guest user, even if the user inputs a
username or password, there is no way to differentiate which users accessed or modified the data on the share. This type of configuration is best suited for
small networks where quick and easy access to the share is more important than the security of the data on the share.

To configure an unauthenticated CIFS share, click "Wizard", then click the "Next" button twice to display the screen shown in Figure 10.4b. Complete the
following fields in this screen:

#. **Share name:** input a name for the share that is useful to you. In this example, the share is named *cifs_insecure*.

#. Click the button for "Windows (CIFS)" and check the box for "Allow Guest".

#. Click the "Ownership" button. Click the drop-down "User" menu and select "nobody". Click the "Return" button to return to the previous screen.

#. Click the "Add" button. **If you forget to do this, the share will not be created**. Clicking the "Add" button will add an entry to the "Name" frame with
   the name that you typed into "Share name".

**Figure 10.4b: Creating an Unauthenticated CIFS Share**

.. image:: images/cifs7.png

Click the "Next" button twice, then the "Confirm" button to create the share. The Wizard will automatically create a dataset for the share and start the CIFS
service for you, so that the share is immediately available. The new share will also be added as an entry to :menuselection:`Sharing --> Windows (CIFS)`.

Users can now access the share from any CIFS client and should not be prompted for their username or password. For example, to access the share from a Windows
system, open Explorer and click on "Network". For this configuration example, a system named *FREENAS* should appear with a share named "insecure_cifs". The
user should be able to copy data to and from the unauthenticated CIFS share.

.. _Configuring Authenticated Access Without a Domain Controller:

Configuring Authenticated Access Without a Domain Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most configuration scenarios require each user to have their own user account and to authenticate before accessing the share. This allows the administrator
to control access to data, provide appropriate permissions to that data, and to determine who accesses and modifies stored data. A Windows domain controller
is not needed for authenticated CIFS shares, which means that additional licensing costs are not required. However, since there is no domain controller to
provide authentication for the network, each user account needs to be created on the FreeNAS速 system. This type of configuration scenario is often used
in home and small networks as it does not scale well if many users accounts are needed.

Before configuring this scenario, determine which users will need authenticated access. While not required for the configuration, it eases troubleshooting if
the username and password that will be created on the FreeNAS速 system matches that information on the client system. Next, determine if each user should have
their own share to store their own data or if several users will be using the same share. The simpler configuration is to make one share per user as it does
not require the creation of groups, adding the correct users to the groups, and ensuring that group permissions are set correctly.

To use the Wizard to create an authenticated CIFS share, enter the following information, as seen in the example in Figure 10.4c.

#. **Share name:** input a name for the share that is useful to you. In this example, the share is named *cifs_user1*.

#. Click the button for "Windows (CIFS)".

#. Click the "Ownership" button. To create the user account on the FreeNAS速 system, type their name into the "User" field and check the "Create User"
   checkbox. This will prompt you to type in and confirm the user's password. **If the user will not be sharing this share with other users**, type their name
   into the "Group" field and click the box "Create Group". **If, however, the share will be used by several users**, instead type in a group name and check
   the "Create Group" box. In the example shown in Figure 10.4d, *user1* has been used for both the user and group name, meaning that this share will only be
   used by *user1*. When finished, click "Return" to return to the screen shown in Figure 10.1d.

#. Click the "Add" button. **If you forget to do this, the share will not be created**. Clicking the "Add" button will add an entry to the "Name" frame with
   the name that you typed into "Share name".

If you wish to configure multiple authenticated shares, repeat for each user, giving each user their own "Share name" and "Ownership". When finished, click
the "Next" button twice, then the "Confirm" button to create the share(s). The Wizard will automatically create a dataset for each share that contains the
correct ownership and start the CIFS service for you, so that the share(s) are immediately available. The new share(s) will also be added as entries to
:menuselection:`Sharing --> Windows (CIFS)`.

**Figure 10.4c: Creating an Authenticated CIFS Share**

.. image:: images/cifs3.png

**Figure 10.4d: Creating the User and Group**

.. image:: images/cifs8.png

You should now be able to test an authenticated share from any CIFS client. For example, to test an authenticated share from a Windows system, open Explorer
and click on "Network". For this configuration example, a system named *FREENAS* should appear with a share named "cifs_user1". If you click on
"cifs_user1", a Windows Security pop-up screen should prompt for that user's username and password. Input the values that were configured for that share, in
this case it is for the user *user1*. Once authenticated, that user can copy data to and from the CIFS share.

To prevent Windows Explorer from hanging when accessing the share, map the share as a network drive. To do this, right-click the share and select "Map network
drive...". Choose a drive letter from the drop-down menu and click the "Finish" button.

Note that Windows systems cache a user's credentials which can cause issues when testing or accessing multiple authenticated shares as only one authentication
is allowed at a time. If you are having problems authenticating to a share and are sure that you are inputting the correct username and password, type
**cmd** in the "Search programs and files" box and use the following command to see if you are already authenticated to a share. In this example, the user has
already authenticated to the *cifs_user1* share::

 net use
 New connections will be remembered.
 
 Status		Local	Remote			Network
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 OK                     \\FREENAS\cifs_user1	Microsoft Windows Network
 The command completed successfully.

To clear the cache::

 net use * /DELETE
 You have these remote connections:
		\\FREENAS\cifs_user1
 Continuing will cancel the connections.
 
 Do you want to continue this operation? <Y/N> [N]: y
 
You will get an additional warning if the share is currently open in Explorer::

 There are open files and/or incomplete directory searches pending on the connection 
 to \\FREENAS|cifs_user1.
 
 Is it OK to continue disconnecting and force them closed? <Y/N> [N]: y
 The command completed successfully.

The next time you access a share using Explorer, you should be prompted to authenticate.

.. index:: Shadow Copies
.. _Configuring Shadow Copies:

Configuring Shadow Copies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Shadow Copies <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_copy>`_, also known as the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) or Previous Versions, is a Microsoft service
for creating volume snapshots. Shadow copies allow you to easily restore previous versions of files from within Windows Explorer. Shadow Copy support is built
into Vista and Windows 7. Windows XP or 2000 users need to install the
`Shadow Copy client <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=16220>`_.

When you create a periodic snapshot task on a ZFS volume that is configured as a CIFS share in FreeNAS速, it is automatically configured to support shadow
copies.

Before using shadow copies with FreeNAS速, be aware of the following caveats:

* If the Windows system is not fully patched to the latest service pack, Shadow Copies may not work. If you are unable to see any previous versions of files
  to restore, use Windows Update to make sure that the system is fully up-to-date.

* Shadow copy support only works for ZFS pools or datasets. This means that the CIFS share must be configured on a volume or dataset, not on a directory.

* Datasets are filesystems and shadow copies cannot traverse filesystems. If you want to be able to see the shadow copies in your child datasets, create
  separate shares for them.

* Shadow copies will not work with a manual snapshot, you must create a periodic snapshot task for the pool or dataset being shared by CIFS or a recursive
  task for a parent dataset.

* The periodic snapshot task should be created and at least one snapshot should exist **before** creating the CIFS share. If you created the CIFS share
  first, restart the CIFS service in :menuselection:`Services --> Control Services`.

* Appropriate permissions must be configured on the volume/dataset being shared by CIFS.

* Users can not delete shadow copies on the Windows system due to the way Samba works. Instead, the administrator can remove snapshots from the FreeNAS速
  administrative GUI. The only way to disable shadow copies completely is to remove the periodic snapshot task and delete all snapshots associated with the
  CIFS share.

To configure shadow copy support, use the instructions in :ref:`Configuring Authenticated Access Without a Domain Controller` to create the desired number of
shares. In this configuration example, a Windows 7 computer has two users: *user1* and
*user2*. For this example, two authenticated shares are created so that each user account has their own share. The first share is named
*user1* and the second share is named
*user2*. Then:

#. Use :menuselection:`Storage --> Periodic Snapshot Tasks --> Add Periodic Snapshot`, to create at least one periodic snapshot task. You can either create
   a snapshot task for each user's dataset, in this example the dataset names are :file:`/mnt/volume1/user1` and :file:`/mnt/volume1/user2`, or you can create
   one periodic snapshot task for the entire volume, in this case :file:`/mnt/volume1`.
   **Before continuing to the next step,** confirm that at least one snapshot for each defined task is displayed in the :menuselection:`Storage --> Snapshots`
   tab. When creating the schedule for the periodic snapshot tasks, keep in mind how often your users need to access modified files and during which days and
   time of day they are likely to make changes.

#. Go to :menuselection:`Sharing --> Windows (CIFS) Shares`. Highlight a share and click its "Edit" button then its "Advanced Mode" button. Click the 
   "Periodic Snapshot Task" drop-down menu and select the periodic snapshot task to use for that share. Repeat for each share being configured as a shadow
   copy. For this example, the share named "/mnt/volume1/user1" is configured to use a periodic snapshot task that was configured to take snapshots of the
   "/mnt/volume1/user1" dataset and the share named "/mnt/volume1/user2" is configured to use a periodic snapshot task that was configured to take snapshots
   of the "/mnt/volume1/user2" dataset.

#. Verify that the CIFS service is set to "ON" in :menuselection:`Services --> Control Services`.

Figure 10.4e provides an example of using shadow copies while logged in as *user1* on the Windows system. In this example, the user right-clicked
*modified file* and selected "Restore previous versions" from the menu. This particular file has three versions: the current version, plus two previous
versions stored on the FreeNAS速 system. The user can choose to open one of the previous versions, copy a previous version to the current folder, or restore
one of the previous versions, which will overwrite the existing file on the Windows system.

.. index:: iSCSI, Internet Small Computer System Interface
.. _Block (iSCSI):

Block (iSCSI)
-------------

iSCSI is a protocol standard for the consolidation of storage data. iSCSI allows FreeNAS速 to act like a storage area network (SAN) over an existing Ethernet
network. Specifically, it exports disk devices over an Ethernet network that iSCSI clients (called initiators) can attach to and mount. Traditional SANs
operate over fibre channel networks which require a fibre channel infrastructure such as fibre channel HBAs, fibre channel switches, and discrete cabling.
iSCSI can be used over an existing Ethernet network, although dedicated networks can be built for iSCSI traffic in an effort to boost performance. iSCSI also
provides an advantage in an environment that uses Windows shell programs; these programs tend to filter "Network Location" but iSCSI mounts are not
filtered.

Before configuring the iSCSI service, you should be familiar with the following iSCSI terminology:

**CHAP:** an authentication method which uses a shared secret and three-way authentication to determine if a system is authorized to access the storage device
and to periodically confirm that the session has not been hijacked by another system. In iSCSI, the initiator (client) performs the CHAP authentication.

**Mutual CHAP:** a superset of CHAP in that both ends of the communication authenticate to each other.

**Initiator:** a client which has authorized access to the storage data on the FreeNAS速 system. The client requires initiator software in order to initiate
the connection to the iSCSI share.

**Target:** a storage resource on the FreeNAS速 system. Every target has a unique name known as an iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN).

**Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS):** protocol for the automated discovery of iSCSI devices on a TCP/IP network.

**Extent:** the storage unit to be shared. It can either be a file or a device.

**Portal:** indicates which IP(s) and port(s) to listen on for connection requests.

**LUN:** stands for Logical Unit Number and represents a logical SCSI device. An initiator negotiates with a target to establish connectivity to a LUN; the
result is an iSCSI connection that emulates a connection to a SCSI hard disk. Initiators treat iSCSI LUNs the same way as they would a raw SCSI or IDE hard
drive; rather than mounting remote directories, initiators format and directly manage filesystems on iSCSI LUNs. When configuring multiple iSCSI LUNs, create
a new target for each LUN. Since iSCSI multiplexes a target with multiple LUNs over the same TCP connection, you will experience contention from TCP if there
is more than one target per LUN.

Beginning with FreeNAS速 9.3, iSCSI is built into the kernel. This version of iSCSI supports Microsoft Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX), meaning that file copies happen
locally, rather than over the network. It also supports the following VAAI (vStorage APIs for Array Integration) primitives, where VAAI is VMware's API
framework that enables certain storage tasks, such as large data moves, to be offloaded from the virtualization hardware to the storage array.

* **unmap:** tells ZFS that the space occupied by deleted files should be freed. Without unmap, ZFS is unaware of freed space made when the initiator deletes
  files. For this feature to work, the initiator must support the unmap command.

* **atomic test and set:** allows multiple initiators to synchronize LUN access in a fine-grained manner rather than locking the whole LUN, which would
  prevent other hosts from accessing the same LUN simultaneously.

* **write same:** when allocating virtual machines with thick provisioning, the necessary write of zeroes is done locally, rather than over the network, so
  virtual machine creation is much quicker.

* **xcopy:** similar to Microsoft ODX, copies happen locally rather than over the network.

* **stun:** if a volume runs out of space, this feature pauses any running virtual machines so that the space issue can be fixed, instead of reporting write
  errors.

* **threshold warning:** the system reports a warning when a configurable capacity is reached. In FreeNAS, this threshold can be configured at the pool
  level when using zvols (see Table 10.5a) or at the extent level (see Table 10.5f) for both file- and device-based extents. Typically, the warning is set at
  the pool level, unless file extents are used, in which case it must be set at the extent level.

* **LUN reporting:** the LUN reports that it is thin provisioned.

To take advantage of these VAAI primitives, create a zvol using the instructions in :ref:`Create zvol` and use it to create a device extent, as described in
:ref:`Extents`.

In order to configure iSCSI:

#.  Review the target global configuration parameters.

#.  Create at least one portal.

#.  Determine which hosts are allowed to connect using iSCSI and create an initiator.

#.  Decide if you will use authentication, and if so, whether it will be CHAP or mutual CHAP. If using authentication, create an authorized access.

#.  Create a target.

#.  Create either a device or a file extent to be used as storage.

#.  Associate a target with an extent.

#.  Start the iSCSI service in :menuselection:`Services --> Control Services`.

The rest of this section describes these steps in more detail.

FreeNAS速 systems with multiple IP addresses or interfaces can use a portal to provide services on different interfaces or subnets. This can be used to
configure multi-path I/O (MPIO). MPIO is more efficient than a link aggregation.

If the FreeNAS速 system has multiple configured interfaces, portals can also be used to provide network access control. For example, consider a system with
four interfaces configured with the following addresses:

192.168.1.1/24

192.168.2.1/24

192.168.3.1/24

192.168.4.1/24

You could create a portal containing the first two IP addresses (group ID 1) and a portal containing the remaining two IP addresses (group ID 2). You could
then create a target named A with a Portal Group ID of 1 and a second target named B with a Portal Group ID of 2. In this scenario, istgt would listen on all
four interfaces, but connections to target A would be limited to the first two networks and connections to target B would be limited to the last two networks.

Another scenario would be to create a portal which includes every IP address **except** for the one used by a management interface. This would prevent iSCSI
connections to the management interface.

The next step is to configure authorized initiators, or the systems which are allowed to connect to the iSCSI targets on the FreeNAS速 system. To configure
which systems can connect, use :menuselection:`Sharing --> Block (iSCSI) --> Initiators --> Add Initiator`, shown in Figure 10.5c.

In the example shown in Figure 10.5d, two groups have been created. Group 1 allows connections from any initiator on any network; Group 2 allows connections
from any initiator on the *10.10.1.0/24* network. Click an initiator's entry to display its "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.

.. note:: if you delete an initiator, a warning will indicate if any targets or target/extent mappings depend upon the initiator. If you confirm the delete,
   these will be deleted as well.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you will be using CHAP or mutual CHAP to provide authentication, you must create an authorized access in
:menuselection:`Sharing --> Block (iSCSI) --> Authorized Accesses --> Add Authorized Access`. This screen is shown in Figure 10.5e.

.. note:: this screen sets login authentication. This is different from discovery authentication which is set in `Target Global Configuration`_.

.. note:: CHAP does not work with GlobalSAN initiators on Mac OS X.

As authorized accesses are added, they will be listed under View Authorized Accesses. In the example shown in Figure 10.5f, three users (*test1*,
*test2*, and
*test3*) and two groups (
*1* and
*2*) have been created, with group 1 consisting of one CHAP user and group 2 consisting of one mutual CHAP user and one CHAP user. Click an authorized access
entry to display its "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.

**Figure 10.5f: Viewing Authorized Accesses**

.. _Targets:

Targets
~~~~~~~

Next, create a Target using :menuselection:`Sharing --> Block (iSCSI) --> Targets --> Add Target`, as shown in Figure 10.5g. A target combines a portal ID,
allowed initiator ID, and an authentication method. Table 10.5e summarizes the settings that can be configured when creating a Target.

.. note:: an iSCSI target creates a block device that may be accessible to multiple initiators. A clustered filesystem is required on the block device, such
   as VMFS used by VMware ESX/ESXi, in order for multiple initiators to mount the block device read/write. If a traditional filesystem such as EXT, XFS, FAT,
   NTFS, UFS, or ZFS is placed on the block device, care must be taken that only one initiator at a time has read/write access or the result will be
   filesystem corruption. If you need to support multiple clients to the same data on a non-clustered filesystem, use CIFS or NFS instead of iSCSI or create
   multiple iSCSI targets (one per client).

.. _Extents:

Extents
~~~~~~~

In iSCSI, the target virtualizes something and presents it as a device to the iSCSI client. That something can be a device extent or a file extent:

**Device extent:** virtualizes an unformatted physical disk, RAID controller, zvol, zvol snapshot, or an existing
`HAST device <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/disks-hast.html>`_.

Virtualizing a single disk is slow as there is no caching but virtualizing a hardware RAID controller has higher performance due to its cache. This type of
virtualization does a pass-through to the disk or hardware RAID controller. None of the benefits of ZFS are provided and performance is limited to the
capabilities of the disk or controller.

Virtualizing a zvol adds the benefits of ZFS such as its read cache and write cache. Even if the client formats the device extent with a different filesystem,
as far as FreeNAS速 is concerned, the data benefits from ZFS features such as block checksums and snapshots.

When determining whether or not to use a file or a device extent, be aware that a zvol is required to take advantage of all VAAI primitives and is recommended when
using virtualization software as the iSCSI initiator. The ATS, WRITE SAME, XCOPY and STUN, primitives are supported by both file and device extents. The UNMAP
primitive is supported by zvols and raw SSDs. The threshold warnings primitive is fully supported by zvols and partially supported by file extents.

**File extent:** allows you to export a portion of a ZFS volume. The advantage of a file extent is that you can create multiple exports per volume.

.. warning::  for performance reasons and to avoid excessive fragmentation, it is recommended to keep the used space of the pool below 50% when using iSCSI.
   As required, you can increase the capacity of an existing extent using the instructions in :ref:`Growing LUNs`.

To add an extent, go to :menuselection:`Services --> ISCSI --> Extents --> Add Extent`. In the example shown in Figure 10.5h, the device extent is using the
:file:`export` zvol that was previously created from the :file:`/mnt/volume1` volume.

Table 10.5f summarizes the settings that can be configured when creating an extent. Note that
**file extent creation will fail if you do not append the name of the file to be created to the volume/dataset name.**

It is recommended to always associate extents to targets in a 1:1 manner, even though the GUI will allow multiple extents to be associated with the same
target.

Once iSCSI has been configured, don't forget to start it in :menuselection:`Services --> Control Services`. Click the red "OFF" button next to iSCSI. After a
second or so, it will change to a blue ON, indicating that the service has started.

.. _Connecting to iSCSI:

Connecting to iSCSI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to access the iSCSI target, clients will need to use iSCSI initiator software.

An iSCSI Initiator client is pre-installed with Windows 7. A detailed how-to for this client can be found
`here <http://www.windowsnetworking.com/articles-tutorials/windows-7/Connecting-Windows-7-iSCSI-SAN.html>`_. A client for Windows 2000, XP, and 2003 can be found
`here <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18986>`_. This `how-to <http://blog.pluralsight.com/freenas-8-iscsi-target-windows-7>`_
shows how to create an iSCSI target for a Windows 7 system.

Mac OS X does not include an initiator.
`globalSAN <http://www.studionetworksolutions.com/globalsan-iscsi-initiator/>`_
is a commercial, easy-to-use Mac initiator.

BSD systems provide command line initiators:
`iscontrol(8) <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=iscontrol>`_ comes with FreeBSD versions 9.x and lower,
`iscsictl(8) <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=iscsictl>`_ comes with FreeBSD versions 10.0 and higher,
`iscsi-initiator(8) <http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?iscsi-initiator++NetBSD-current>`_ comes with NetBSD, and
`iscsid(8) <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/./man8/iscsid.8?query=iscsid>`_ comes with OpenBSD.

Some Linux distros provide the command line utility :command:`iscsiadm` from
`Open-iSCSI <http://www.open-iscsi.org/>`_. Use a web search to see if a package exists for your distribution should the command not exist on your Linux
system.

If you add a LUN while :command:`iscsiadm` is already connected, it will not see the new LUN until you rescan using :command:`iscsiadm -m node -R`.
Alternately, use :command:`iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p portal_IP` to find the new LUN and :command:`iscsiadm -m node -T LUN_Name -l` to log into the LUN.

Instructions for connecting from a VMware ESXi Server can be found at
`How to configure FreeNAS 8 for iSCSI and connect to ESX(i) <http://www.vladan.fr/how-to-configure-freenas-8-for-iscsi-and-connect-to-esxi/>`_. Note that the
requirements for booting vSphere 4.x off iSCSI differ between ESX and ESXi. ESX requires a hardware iSCSI adapter while ESXi requires specific iSCSI boot
firmware support. The magic is on the booting host side, meaning that there is no difference to the FreeNAS速 configuration. See the
`iSCSI SAN Configuration Guide <http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vsphere4/r41/vsp_41_iscsi_san_cfg.pdf>`_
for details.

If you can see the target but not connect to it, check the "Discovery Auth" settings in "Target Global Configuration".

If the LUN is not discovered by ESXi, make sure that promiscuous mode is set to "Accept" in the vSwitch.

.. _Growing LUNs:

Growing LUNs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method used to grow the size of an existing iSCSI LUN depends on whether the LUN is backed by a file extent or a zvol. Both methods are described in this
section.

After the LUN is expanded using one of the methods below, use the tools from the initiator software to grow the partitions and the filesystems it contains.

.. _Zvol Based LUN:

Zvol Based LUN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To grow a zvol based LUN, go to :menuselection:`Storage --> Volumes --> View Volumes`, highlight the zvol to be grown, and click its "Edit zvol" button. In
the example shown in Figure 10.5j, the current size of the zvol named *zvol1* is 4GB.

**Figure 10.5j: Editing an Existing Zvol**

.. image:: images/grow1.png

Input the new size for the zvol in the "Size" field and click the "Edit ZFS Volume" button. This menu will close and the new size for the zvol will
immediately show in the "Used" column of the "View Volumes" screen.

.. _File Extent Based LUN:

File Extent Based LUN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To grow a file extent based LUN, go to :menuselection:`Services --> iSCSI --> File Extents --> View File Extents` to determine the path of the file extent to
grow. Open Shell to grow the extent. This example grows :file:`/mnt/volume1/data` by 2G::

 truncate -s +2g /mnt/volume1/data

Go back to :menuselection:`Services --> iSCSI --> File Extents --> View File Extents` and click the "Edit" button for the file extent. Set the size to *0* as
this causes the iSCSI target to use the new size of the file.
